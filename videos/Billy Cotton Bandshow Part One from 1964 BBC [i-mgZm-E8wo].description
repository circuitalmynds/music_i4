The first part of the much loved Billy Cotton Bandshow programme. A must for Saturday night viewing in the 1950's and 60's. Watching this show it is very apparent that TV at the time was based on the 'theatre' style. Look out for the 'set' changes on screen, and the change of costumes whilst the show continues - it is pure nostalgia, wonderful!.   It is sad to note that all the main performers in this programme are now no longer with us.  The Copyright in this video segment belongs to the BBC. Â© 1964 BBC
