This year marks the 100th anniversary of the theremin’s invention. To celebrate the instrument that sparked a century of electronic music innovation, we present to you a new limited-edition Moog theremin: Claravox Centennial.

Set among the baroque architecture and expansive gardens of Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte, French musician Grégoire Blanc channels theremin marvel Clara Rockmore in a stunning Claravox Centennial performance of Claude Debussy’s “Clair de Lune” alongside pianist Orane Donnadieu. This tribute to the timeless classical duets of Rockmore and her sister, pianist Nadia Reisenberg, captures the beauty of the theremin’s distinct tone and personality—characteristics that will continue to captivate audiences into the next century.
